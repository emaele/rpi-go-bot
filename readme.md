<h1>Raspberry Pi Go Bot</h1>

<p>Simple bot written in Golang, I treat it like a school project.<p>

<h3>Config</h3>

Before building it you need to setup your id and token bot. You can get the first one my sending a message to ```@RawDataBot[1]```

```go
var (
	myID     int64 = 000000           
```
TokenBot can be obtained by creating a new bot with ```@BotFather[2]``` 

```go
	tokenBot       = "Your token here" 
)
```
